# Learn-Spanish---flash-cards

This python program uses tkinter library for a user friendly interface, each flash card presents with a Spanish word. After a short delay, the card will flip, revealing the English translation. Use the buttons to indicate whether you knew the word or not, and proceed to the next word. Your score will be updated accordingly. The unkown words will be stored on a csv file "words to learn", so the user can review and before trying again.
