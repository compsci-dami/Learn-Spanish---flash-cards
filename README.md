# Learn-Spanish---flash-cards

This Python program uses the Tkinter library to create a user-friendly interface for language learning through flashcards. Each flashcard displays a word in Spanish, and after a brief delay, flips to reveal its English translation. Users can interact with the program using buttons to indicate whether they knew the word. Based on the responses, the score is updated accordingly.

Words not recognized by the user are saved to a CSV file named "words_to_learn.csv", allowing users to easily review them before attempting again. This feature ensures personalized learning, focusing on areas that need improvement.
